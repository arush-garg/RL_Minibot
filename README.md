# encoder training reinforce*

In this project, a reinforcement learning model has been deployed onto a drive base. The goal is for the model to be able to balance a freely rotating pole by moving forward and backward.

The model was first trained in the OpenAI Gym `cartpole-vx` environment. Once trained, it was fine-tuned on the drive base
